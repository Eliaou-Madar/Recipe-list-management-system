In this project we will use the PyQt library and the Python language to create an integrated display of templates from the *MV family and many others
others with the aim of creating a code base allowing for extensive expansion, maintenance and testing, and with it a collection of micro-
Services using the NET.ASP Web API and #C language and a variety of other design patterns.
