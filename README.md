Today, every software system is designed as a distributed system, which includes several Tiers and in addition interfacing with cloud services.
In this project we will design and develop a system that includes a display subsystem, an application server and interfacing with selected cloud services.
The system will display a list of items of your choice (galaxies, planets, asteroids, songs, movies or foods) and will strengthen
This list includes user alerts.

In this project we will use the PyQt library and the Python language to create an integrated display of templates from the *MV family and many others
others with the aim of creating a code base allowing for extensive expansion, maintenance and testing, and with it a collection of micro-
Services using the NET.ASP Web API and #C language and a variety of other design patterns.

Requirements:
1. Only one type of user for the system:
1.1 The admin user will archive lists.
2. The system will support the following user processes:
2.1 Entering an item that includes a picture, features, keywords, description and comments.
2.2 Displaying a list of items based on keyword search.
2.3 Deleting and updating item data.
3. The list data will be saved in a database within the application server.
4. The system will call at least two cloud services to extract data (such as lists or images) or run processing
(such as calling for AI services)
